Robots with bioships are less bad at farming.

Specifically:
[ulist]
    [*]In vanilla, robot empires (whether gestalt or individualistic) have a bonus to energy generation (+2 per 100 pops) and a penalty to food generation (-1 per 100 pops).
    [*]This makes sense because they usually don't need food. However, if their empire uses bioships, they probably need a [i]lot[/i] of food.
    [*]To mitigate this, if a robot empire uses bioships, its pops generate +1 food and -1 energy per 100 pops.
[/ulist]

It will still be hard to roll Food-related research as a robot empire, since the probability is downweighted (x0.5). Make sure to keep at least one food district in your empire, or else that probability will be [i]heavily[/i] downweighted (x0.01).
